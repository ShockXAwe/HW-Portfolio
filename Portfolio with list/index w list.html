            Hi there!
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for coming to my page, I suppose you want to know a little about me since you clicked on the "About
            me" link above. Lets see what can I say...
        </p>
        <p>
            For starters I'm currently enrolled in Northwestern Professional Schools for web developement. I been in the
            professional tech field for a little over 11 years now and love it.
            Since i was younger I was always into gadgets and technology. One of the biggest influences had to be video
            games. I loved playing them when I was younger, and I still do till this day!
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from technology, I enjoy working out (boxing), Djing at clubs/bars, driving my Evolution X, and
            riding my Ducati during summers. I would say that I'm definately a city guy. Born and raised in Chicago,
            IL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every year for the last 3 years I go to Blizzcon out in Anehiem California. As I mentioned earlier I love
            gaming, specifically PC gaming. Yes I do have a crazy built computer at home (2 of them to be exact).
            Blizzcon hosts the Overwatch World Championships every year, that being said, Overwatch is my number 1 game
            of choice that I play.
            After attending Blizzcon and researching the company Blizzard, I realized that my dream is to work at
            Blizzard Entertainment. Call it a long shot but it certainly is something I'm really aiming towards with a
            passion.
            I hope after completeing this course and building up my experience throughout the time at my current place
            of employment, that dream will become a reality!
